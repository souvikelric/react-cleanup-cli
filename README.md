# Vite React CLI Tool

This command-line interface (CLI) tool helps you quickly create a React project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool and development server. It provides an interactive experience to customize your project setup by:

1. Allowing you to choose whether to include TypeScript or not.
2. Offering an interactive prompt to clean up your newly created React project based on your preferences.

This CLI is built using TypeScript to provide type safety and improved development experience.

## Features

- **Create React Projects with Vite**: Create a new React project with just a single command.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Choose whether to include TypeScript in your project.
- **Cleanup Options**: After project creation, decide which files and configurations to clean up for a leaner project setup.
- **TypeScript-Based**: The CLI itself is developed using TypeScript to provide better tooling and type checking.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the CLI, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: You need Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. If you already have Node.js, you should have npm as well.
